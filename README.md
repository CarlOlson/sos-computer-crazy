# A repo for when I feel computer crazy

[![github doesnt allow unicode in repo names and i dont like that](http://img.youtube.com/vi/E7NiANnriGc/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7NiANnriGc "")

Please steal these ideas and share them with me.

# Older Ideas

- man files should be emeded in executables
  - could easily add a ELF metadata section for this
- CLI autocomplete should be described in BNF and embeded in executables

- CLI programs should output HTML/CSS to be rendered by web terminals
  - this should have W3C standard :^)
- create a window manager in HTML/CSS w/ windows as iframes
- create desktop manager based around web standards -- qt/gnome should die
- create a slack alternative that is CLI first
  - share terminal/error/file_location/code_snippet with...
  - view images/videos w/ web terminal integration
  - record/share/replay CLI steps
  - graphql api and stable HTML5 interface for tinkering
  - handle full git PR process via terminal
- create a standard dotfile for jump key preferences (tfw dvorak T.T)

I'm forgetting something and it is driving me computer crazy...

Time for a drink :+1:
